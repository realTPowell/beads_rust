# br sync Safety Model

> How `br sync` keeps your repository safe.

---

## Overview

`br` (beads_rust) is a local-first issue tracker. This document covers the
safety model for the `br sync` command, which synchronizes your SQLite database
with a JSONL file for git-based collaboration.

**Key safety principle**: with the default `.beads/` paths, `br sync` will never
modify your source code or execute git commands. External JSONL paths require
explicit opt-in and remain subject to extension, symlink, traversal, and `.git/`
guards.

---

## What br sync Does

| Operation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Export** (`--flush-only`) | Writes issues from SQLite to `.beads/issues.jsonl` |
| **Import** (`--import-only`) | Reads issues from JSONL into SQLite |
| **Merge** (`--merge`) | Three-way merge of base snapshot, SQLite, and JSONL |
| **Rebuild** (`--import-only --rebuild`) | Treats JSONL as authoritative and rebuilds SQLite from it |
| **Status** (`--status`) | Shows sync state without modifying anything |

All file I/O is confined to the `.beads/` directory by default.

---

## What br sync Will NEVER Do

These are explicit design non-goals for the sync command. `br sync` will never:

1. **Execute git commands** - No commits, no pushes, no staging
2. **Modify files outside its sync allowlist** - Default writes stay in `.beads/`; external JSONL paths require explicit opt-in
3. **Install or invoke git hooks** - Fully manual hook setup if desired
4. **Run as a daemon** - Simple CLI only, no background processes
5. **Auto-commit changes** - Every git operation requires explicit user action
6. **Connect to external services** - Offline-first, no network calls

Other explicitly requested br commands have their own scope: for example,
`br changelog`, `br orphans`, and commit-activity `br stats` inspect git
history, while `br agents`, `br doctor --repair`, `br config`, and `br
completions -o` can write the user-requested files they manage. Those commands
do not weaken the `br sync` invariants described here.

## Safety Guards

### Export Guards

| Guard | What it prevents | Override |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| **Empty DB guard** | Exporting 0 issues over a JSONL with N issues | `--force` |
| **Stale DB guard** | Exporting when DB is missing issues from JSONL | `--force` |

### Import Guards

| Guard | What it prevents | Override |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| **Conflict marker scan** | Importing unresolved merge conflicts | **None** - must resolve conflicts |
| **Schema validation** | Importing malformed JSON | **None** - must fix JSONL |
| **Tombstone protection** | Resurrecting deleted issues | **None** - by design |

### Merge Guards

| Guard | What it prevents | Override |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| **Both modified conflict** | Silently choosing between divergent SQLite and JSONL edits | `--force`, `--force-db`, `--force-jsonl` |
| **Delete vs modify conflict** | Silently deleting one side's edit | `--force`, `--force-db`, `--force-jsonl` |
| **Convergent creation conflict** | Silently choosing between independently created same-ID issues | `--force`, `--force-db`, `--force-jsonl` |

## Using --force Safely

The `--force` flag bypasses export safety guards. Use it only when you understand the consequences:

```bash
# Safe: Export after intentionally clearing the database
br sync --flush-only --force

# Safe: Import after confirming JSONL is authoritative
br sync --import-only --force

# Safe: Merge after confirming the newer timestamp should win
br sync --merge --force
```

**When to use --force:**
- After a deliberate database reset
- When JSONL is known to be authoritative
- During recovery from corruption
- During `--merge`, when timestamp-based conflict resolution is intentional

**When NOT to use --force:**
- Routinely (defeats the purpose of guards)
- Without understanding why a guard triggered
- When the error message is unclear

Use `--force-db` or `--force-jsonl` instead of `--force` when you want a specific
side of a merge conflict to win regardless of timestamps:

```bash
# Keep local SQLite changes for merge conflicts
br sync --merge --force-db

# Keep JSONL changes for merge conflicts
br sync --merge --force-jsonl
```

The merge base is `.beads/beads.base.jsonl`. A successful export or merge updates
that snapshot so future `--merge` runs can distinguish local SQLite edits from
JSONL edits.

`--force-db`, `--force-jsonl`, and `--force` are mutually exclusive during
`--merge`. They only resolve semantic merge conflicts; they do not bypass JSONL
syntax validation or unresolved git conflict markers.

---

## Rebuilding From JSONL

Use `--rebuild` only when JSONL is the source of truth and the SQLite database
should be made to match it:

```bash
# Equivalent forms
br sync --rebuild
br sync --import-only --rebuild
```

`--rebuild` is import-only. It is rejected with `--flush-only` and `--merge`.
After importing JSONL, br removes database entries absent from JSONL and
preserves deletion tombstones when they are still needed for sync safety.

When rebuild is part of corruption recovery, br preserves the original database
family under `.beads/.br_recovery/` before creating the repaired database. These
artifacts are evidence for diagnosis; inspect them before pruning anything.

If `--rename-prefix` is combined with rebuild, imported IDs may be rewritten to
the configured prefix. In that mode, br skips set-difference orphan cleanup
because the original JSONL IDs no longer match the rewritten database IDs. If
open-time recovery already rebuilt the database before `--rename-prefix` could
apply, br reports a rerun command with the needed flags.

---

## External JSONL Paths

By default, sync operates on `.beads/issues.jsonl`. To use a different path:

```bash
# Set via environment variable
export BEADS_JSONL=/path/to/issues.jsonl
br sync --flush-only --allow-external-jsonl
```

Paths outside `.beads/` require the explicit `--allow-external-jsonl` opt-in.

**Backups:** When exporting to a JSONL file that lives inside `.beads/` (including custom
`BEADS_JSONL` paths that still target `.beads/`), br creates timestamped backups in
`.beads/.br_history/` before overwriting.

**Safety notes:**
- External paths bypass the default confinement
- Symlinks pointing outside `.beads/` are rejected
- If import preflight rejects a path, it stops before opening or parsing that path
- Automatic flush validates the JSONL target before inspecting an existing file
- Startup auto-import and no-db prefix inference validate existing JSONL targets before hashing or reading them
- `br sync --allow-external-jsonl` carries that path policy through startup recovery, config loading, and no-db startup imports
- Paths are canonicalized before use

## Typical Workflow

### Starting a session
```bash
br sync --status           # Check if import is needed
br sync --import-only      # Import any JSONL changes
```

### Ending a session
```bash
br sync --flush-only       # Export DB changes to JSONL
git add .beads/            # Stage for commit (manual!)
git commit -m "Update issues"
```

### After pulling changes
```bash
git pull
br sync --import-only      # Import collaborators' changes
```

## Error Messages and What They Mean

### "Refusing to export empty database..."

**Cause**: Your database has 0 issues, but the JSONL file has existing issues.

**Fix**:
- Run `br sync --import-only` first to populate the database
- Or use `--force` if you intentionally want an empty export

### "Refusing to export stale database..."

**Cause**: The JSONL file contains issues that don't exist in your database.

**Fix**:
- Run `br sync --import-only` first to import the missing issues
- Or use `--force` if you intentionally want to lose those issues

### "Merge conflict markers detected..."

**Cause**: The JSONL file contains unresolved git merge conflicts.

**Fix**:
- Open the JSONL file and resolve the conflicts manually
- Look for `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>` markers
- `--force` will NOT bypass this check

## Why These Guardrails Exist

### The Incident That Shaped br

The Go predecessor (`bd`) suffered a catastrophic failure where `bd sync` **deleted all repository source files**. This wasn't a theoretical risk—it actually happened, destroying irreplaceable work. The root cause was a sync operation that had too much authority: it could execute git commands, modify arbitrary files, and make irreversible changes without explicit confirmation.

This incident motivated every design decision in `br`'s safety model.

### Defense in Depth

`br` employs multiple layers of protection:

| Layer | Protection | Failure Mode Blocked |
|-------|------------|---------------------|
| **No sync git operations** | `br sync` has no runtime git subprocess path | Eliminates the primary attack vector from the original incident |
| **Sync write allowlist** | Default writes stay in `.beads/`; external JSONL writes require opt-in | Prevents accidental modification of source code, configs, or system files |
| **Path validation** | Rejects `.git`, traversal (`../`), symlink escapes, and disallowed extensions | Blocks path injection attacks and symlink-based escapes |
| **Atomic writes** | Uses temp file + rename; partial failures don't corrupt | Prevents data loss from interrupted operations |
| **Safety guards** | Empty DB and stale DB guards require `--force` to override | Makes destructive operations explicit and intentional |

### How Tests Enforce Safety

The safety model is backed by an extensive test suite (**635+ tests**) that ensures these guarantees cannot regress:

- **Path guard unit tests** (`sync::path::tests`): 22 tests verify that traversal attempts, external paths, and disallowed file types are rejected
- **File tree snapshot tests** (`e2e_sync_git_safety.rs`): Integration tests take complete snapshots of the directory tree before and after sync, verifying that only `.beads/issues.jsonl` and related files are touched
- **Git mutation tests**: Regression tests verify that no commits, staged changes, or `.git/` modifications occur during sync
- **Atomic write tests** (`e2e_sync_failure_injection.rs`): Tests inject failures mid-export to verify the original file is preserved
- **Conflict marker tests**: Import preflight tests verify that merge conflicts are detected and rejected

### How Logging Aids Diagnosis

When sync operations occur, structured logging records safety-critical decisions:

```bash
# Enable verbose logging to see safety checks
br sync --flush-only -v
br sync --flush-only -vv  # Even more detail
```

Key logged events:
- Path validation results (allowed/rejected with reason)
- Conflict marker scan results
- Export guard trigger events (empty DB, stale DB)
- Atomic write operations (temp file creation, rename)

If a safety guard triggers unexpectedly, the verbose log will show exactly why.

### The Core Guarantee

**With the default `.beads/` paths, even if `br sync` has a bug, it cannot
delete your source code.**

This is not a best-effort promise—it's an architectural constraint enforced by:
1. Sync code that does not call git
2. Path validation that rejects anything outside `.beads/` unless an external JSONL path is explicitly allowed
3. Tests that would fail if these constraints were violated
